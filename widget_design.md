- **Dynamic**: Shows current day of week

## Interaction Flow

### Morning Decision Process
1. User opens widget (expanded view)
2. Sees decision criteria summary (optional)
3. Selects capacity level (üî¥/üü°/üü¢)
4. Views today's plan based on selection
5. Widget saves choice to tracking file

### Throughout the Day
1. User can re-open widget to review plan
2. Can change capacity level if needed (downgrade only)
3. Plan updates automatically
4. **Activity/Symptom/Intervention logging**:
   - **Symptom logging (NEW ENHANCED FLOW)**:
     - Click symptom button to open symptom selection radio dialog
     - Select from radio options (with checkmarks and counts) or choose "Other..." for custom input
     - If "Other..." selected: Enter custom symptom name in edit dialog
     - Choose severity level (1-10 scale): "1 - Minimal" to "10 - Extreme" in radio dialog
     - Item logged with severity metadata (Google Sheets gets full info, local storage gets base symptom name only)
     - Automatic cancellation handling prevents dialog closing issues
     - Can cancel at any level to return to previous step or main widget
   - **Activity/Intervention logging (LEGACY SYSTEM)**:
     - Click buttons to open single dialogs  
     - Previously logged items show with checkmarks and counts
     - Select items to log (counts increment for repeated selections)
     - Custom items available via "Other..." option
5. **Visual feedback**: Toast confirmations show successful logging
6. **Immediate dialog refresh**: Dialog automatically refreshes to show updated counts after logging

## File Structure Integration

### Data Sources
- `/Long Covid/plans/decision_criteria.md` - Decision criteria
- `/Long Covid/plans/days/{day}.md` - Day-specific templates
- `/Long Covid/plans/tracking.md` - Daily selections log
- `activities.md` - Available activities for logging with required specifications
- `symptoms.md` - Available symptoms for logging
- `interventions.md` - Available interventions for logging with required specifications

### Required Items Specification Format
Activities and interventions can be marked as required using special syntax:

**activities.md example:**
```markdown
## Physical
- Light walk
- Physio (full) {Required: Mon,Wed,Fri}
- Yin Yoga {Required}

## Work
- Work from home
```

**interventions.md example:**
```markdown

```

**Syntax:**
- `{Required}` - Required every day
- `{Required: Mon,Wed,Fri}` - Required only on specific days (case insensitive)
- Day abbreviations: `sun`, `mon`, `tue`, `wed`, `thu`, `fri`, `sat`

### Internal Storage (AIO Preferences)
- `daily_logs[date]` - Daily tracking counts for symptoms/activities/interventions
  ```lua
  daily_logs = {
    ["2025-01-21"] = {
      symptoms = {
        ["Fatigue (severity: 5)"] = 1, 
        ["Brain fog (severity: 3)"] = 2,
        ["Custom Headache (severity: 7)"] = 1
      },
      activities = {["Light walk"] = 1, ["Physio (full)"] = 2},
      interventions = {["Vitamin D"] = 1, ["Rest"] = 3}
    }
  }
  ```

### Tracking File Format
```markdown

```

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Overview
The widget uses a modular architecture with the following components:

- **Main Widget** (`long-covid-pacing.lua`): User interface handling and AIO integration
- **Core Module** (`long_covid_core.lua`): Business logic and data processing
- **Managers**: Specialized components for different responsibilities
  - `dialog_manager`: Handles legacy dialog interactions and data loading (activities/interventions)
  - `dialog_flow_manager`: **NEW** - Manages multi-level dialog flows with severity tracking (symptoms)
  - `cache_manager`: Manages file caching and data persistence
  - `button_mapper`: Maps button interactions to actions
  - `ui_generator`: Creates UI elements based on state

### Dialog Stack System (NEW)
**Components**:
- `DialogStack` class (`long_covid_core.lua:1082-1123`): Stack operations for multi-level flows
- `Dialog Flow Manager` (`long_covid_core.lua:1170-1351`): Orchestrates complex dialog sequences  
- `Flow Definitions` (`long_covid_core.lua:1126-1167`): Declarative flow configurations

**AIO Platform Compatibility**:
- **Issue**: AIO Launcher has a bug where radio dialogs don't trigger `on_dialog_action` for OK/selection events
- **Solution**: Converted all symptom flow dialogs from list‚Üíradio to radio‚Üíradio pattern
- **Benefit**: Consistent dialog API usage prevents `on_dialog_action` callback issues
- **Implementation**: Both symptom selection and severity dialogs now use `dialogs:show_radio_dialog()`

**Cancellation Handling**:
- **Issue**: AIO sends spurious cancel events after dialog selections
- **Solution**: `ignore_next_cancel` flag system automatically ignores expected cancel events
- **Trigger**: Set to `true` whenever a dialog is shown, cleared when spurious cancel processed
- **Result**: Multi-level dialogs remain stable during transitions

**Architecture**:
```lua
-- Dialog Stack manages context across multiple dialog levels
dialog_stack = {
    category = "symptom",
    dialogs = {
        {type = "list", name = "main_list", data = {...}},
        {type = "radio", name = "severity", data = {...}}
    }
}

-- Flow Manager coordinates the entire user journey
dialog_flow_manager:start_flow("symptom")
  ‚Üí dialog_flow_manager:handle_dialog_result(user_selection)  
  ‚Üí dialog_flow_manager:complete_flow() -- with severity metadata
```

### Key Functions
```lua
-- Main widget lifecycle
function on_resume()
    load_prefs_data()        -- Load preferences into globals
    check_daily_reset()      -- Clear tracking on new day
    load_data()             -- Load plan files via cache_manager
    render_widget()         -- Generate UI via ui_generator
end

function on_click(idx)
    -- Uses button_mapper to identify action from clicked element
    local action_type, level = button_mapper:identify_button_action(elem_text)
    -- Handles capacity selection, dialog opening, etc.
end

-- Core business logic (from long_covid_core.lua)
function M.log_item(daily_logs, item_type, item_name)
    -- Increment count for symptoms/activities/interventions
    -- Thread-safe logging with immediate persistence
end

function M.format_list_items(items, item_type, daily_logs, required_activities, required_interventions)
    -- Add checkmarks and counts to logged items
    -- Visual differentiation for required vs optional items
end

function M.check_daily_reset(last_selection_date, selected_level, daily_capacity_log, daily_logs)
    -- Handles daily reset logic and preference management
end
```

## User Experience Goals

## Daily Tracking Examples

### Dialog Visual Differentiation
When opening activity/symptom/intervention dialogs, items are visually differentiated based on daily usage:

**Example Activity Dialog:**
```
Log Activity
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ ‚úÖ Physio (full) (1)           ‚îÇ  ‚Üê Required & completed (green checkmark)
‚îÇ ‚úì Light walk (2)               ‚îÇ  ‚Üê Optional & logged (regular checkmark)
‚îÇ ‚ö†Ô∏è Yin Yoga                    ‚îÇ  ‚Üê Required & not completed (warning)
‚îÇ    Desk work                   ‚îÇ  ‚Üê Optional & not logged (spacing)
‚îÇ    Reading                     ‚îÇ  ‚Üê Optional & not logged (spacing)
‚îÇ    Other...                    ‚îÇ  ‚Üê Custom option
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

**Key Features:**
- **Green checkmarks (‚úÖ)**: Required items that have been completed
- **Regular checkmarks (‚úì)**: Optional items that have been logged
- **Warning icons (‚ö†Ô∏è)**: Required items that haven't been completed yet
- **Count numbers**: Show frequency `(1)`, `(2)`, `(3)`, etc.
- **Indentation**: Unlogged optional items indented for visual alignment
- **Bracket handling**: Items like "Physio (full)" preserve original brackets
- **Real-time updates**: Counts increment immediately when items are selected
- **Instant feedback**: Dialog refreshes automatically after logging to show updated counts
- **Button colors**: Activity/intervention buttons are red until all required items completed

## Energy Level Tracking

The energy level logging feature provides continuous monitoring of energy throughout the day on a 1-10 scale, with time-based visual feedback to encourage regular logging.

### Energy Levels Scale
1. **Completely drained** - No energy left
2. **Very low** - Struggling to function
3. **Low** - Below normal, limited activity
4. **Below average** - Functioning but tired
5. **Average** - Normal baseline energy
6. **Above average** - Good energy levels
7. **Good** - Feeling strong and capable
8. **Very good** - High energy, productive
9. **Excellent** - Peak performance
10. **Peak energy** - Maximum energy and vitality

### Button Color Logic
- **Red (#dc3545)**: Never logged today - encourages first log
- **Yellow (#ffc107)**: Last logged 4+ hours ago - reminder to update
- **Green (#28a745)**: Logged within last 4 hours - up to date

### Data Storage
Energy levels are stored with timestamps, allowing for:
- Time-series analysis of daily energy patterns
- Correlation with activities, symptoms, and interventions
- Identification of energy peaks and crashes
- Long-term trend analysis

## Intervention Tracking

The intervention logging feature allows tracking of medications, supplements, treatments, and lifestyle changes to help determine their effectiveness for long covid management.

### Intervention Categories
- **Medications**: Prescribed and over-the-counter medications
- **Supplements**: Vitamins, minerals, and other supplements
- **Treatments**: Physical therapies, breathing exercises, meditation
- **Lifestyle**: Rest adjustments, hydration, stress management

### Usage Pattern
1. Select daily capacity level first
2. Log interventions throughout the day as they are taken/performed
3. Track patterns over time to identify what helps with specific symptoms or capacity levels
4. Use "Other..." option for unlisted interventions that get added to custom tracking

## Symptom Severity Tracking (NEW)

### Severity Scale
All symptoms are now tracked with a 1-10 severity scale:
- **1 - Minimal**: Barely noticeable, doesn't affect daily activities
- **2 - Mild**: Noticeable but easily manageable
- **3 - Mild-Moderate**: Slightly bothersome, minor impact on activities
- **4 - Moderate**: Noticeable impact, some difficulty with tasks
- **5 - Moderate-High**: Significant discomfort, affects concentration
- **6 - High**: Major impact on daily functioning
- **7 - High-Severe**: Very difficult to manage, limited ability to function
- **8 - Severe**: Extremely difficult, major limitations
- **9 - Very Severe**: Nearly incapacitating, very limited function
- **10 - Extreme**: Completely incapacitating, unable to function

### Enhanced Logging Examples
**Before (Legacy)**: `Fatigue`, `Brain fog`, `Headache`
**Now (With Severity)**: `Fatigue (severity: 7)`, `Brain fog (severity: 4)`, `Custom Migraine (severity: 9)`

### Multi-Level Dialog Flow
1. **Symptom Selection**: Choose from radio dialog options or "Other..." for custom entry
2. **Custom Input** (if needed): Enter custom symptom name in edit dialog 
3. **Severity Rating**: Select 1-10 scale in radio dialog for all symptoms
4. **Completion**: Symptom logged with severity metadata
   - Google Sheets: Full severity info (e.g., "Fatigue (severity: 5)")
   - Local storage: Base symptom name only (e.g., "Fatigue") for count markers

### Data Benefits
- **Pattern recognition**: Track severity trends over time
- **Treatment correlation**: See which interventions help specific severity levels
- **Capacity planning**: Understand symptom severity impact on daily capacity
- **Medical communication**: Provide precise symptom data to healthcare providers
